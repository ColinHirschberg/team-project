Researching about overregularization of certain language rules in Japanese by children. 
what is overregularization?:
  In English
    Youngh children learnin English sometimes mistakenly use the rule for making regular past tense verbs to irregular conjugation verbs.
    ex) go -> *goed
  In Japanese
    when making a "possible verb", a suffix "rare" attaches to the root verb if the root verb ends at a vowel. This rule isn't used when the root verb ends at a consonant.
    But children in certain ages sometimes attaches "rare" to root verbs regardless of the difference in the end of the verb.
