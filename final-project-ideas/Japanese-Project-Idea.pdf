#In Japanese, there is a form that adds "-rareru" to certain verbs, that essential means that the verb is "possible to do." For example, the verb "taberu" means "to eat," and
#its potential form is "taberareru." However, there is a developing phenomenon called "ra nuki" which essentially means, "taking out the 'ra,'" which is happening in Japanese
#speakers. This change is especially noted to be prevalent in younger Japanese speakers, so studying this is within the subfield of language change. Seeing the ways that language
#changes should certainly be important to a linguist, and I think a corpus would be perfect for investigating to see if given datasets show the same general trend that our 
#background knowledge seems to tell us, and we can hypothesize about why this is or isn't the case.
#There are several studies in existence about it:

#Here's one source that describes this phenomenon:
#Matsuda, Kenjiro. (1993) Dissecting analogical leveling quantitatively: The case of the innovative potential suffix in Tokyo Japanese. Language Variation and Change

#Another source made a study on the same subject, and its findings also found, very strongly, the generation difference in the occurance of this phenomenon:
